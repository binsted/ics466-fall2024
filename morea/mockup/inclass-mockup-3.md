# In class: UI Mockup (3)

Your Phase 1 App is due tomorrow.  I am providing the entire class period today for you to work with your group on the project.

Remember: you have to create two artifacts:
1. A running Flutter app with screens related to your project idea.
2. A GitHub Pages (or equivalent) project site that documents your project.

I will stay in this room for the entire period. If you or your team would like me to review any aspect of your submission as it stands now, feel free to come up and see me. 

**I strongly suggest you use this time to work in the same place at the same time.**

I will stay in this room until the end of class in case your group has questions for me.
