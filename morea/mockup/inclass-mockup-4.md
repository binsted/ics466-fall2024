# In class: UI Mockup (4)

## Walkthrough of AGC Mockup 2

## Group work: Create a data model.

For the next phase of your mockup, you will be creating sample data to populate your user interface.  This is a good time to start designing the "data model" for your application. 

As seniors and graduate students, you should all have a general understanding of data modeling.  For this exercise, the goal is to create a simple entity relationship diagram (ERD) that illustrates (1) the basic "entities" in your system, and (2) the basic "relationships" between them and their cardinality (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many). 

While there are many specialized tools for creating ERDs, it is possible to do a reasonable job using Google Slides. I have created a template that you can use that implements an ERD for the AGC Mockup:

<https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18MqmMd_RSu1JYEQd0bpgT0ejOmMr40EhqMIurriKHnA/edit?usp=sharing>

So, the step for this group work are:

1. Divide into groups. 
2. Make a copy of the above template. Make this template editable by anyone and share the link with your group members.
3. Edit the title of the Google Slide, and the text at the top of the slide so that it names your project.
4. Design your ERD, using the existing entities and relationships as examples.

Near the end of the period, you will share your slide into the #erd channel and we will take a look at your initial data model.
