# In class: Flutterpalooza (3)

## Setup: Best and Worst of Flutter

Divide up into groups of 3-4. 

Introduce yourself to your group mates.

One person should create a google doc and provide write access to everyone on the internet, then share the link with the other group members.

Take three minutes to come to consensus on the three best things about Flutter, and the three worst things about Flutter (in your group's opinion).

You will present your findings to the class.
