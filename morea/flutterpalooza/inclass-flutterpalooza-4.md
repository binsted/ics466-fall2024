# In class: FTW Wireframe Assignment

Today's class is devoted to work on your FTW Wireframe assignment (due tonight)!

You should have at least six wireframes that illustrate "innovative" aspects of your design. (If you have more, so much the better).

You can work alone or in groups. This does not obligate you to work alone or in groups, or with the same group in future.

I will circulate in class today to review all of the designs. 

## Submission instructions

By 11pm tonight, you must upload the URL to your wireframe designs to Laulima.
