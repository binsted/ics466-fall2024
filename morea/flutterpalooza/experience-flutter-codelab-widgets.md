# Flutter Codelab: Introduction to Widgets

## Task


For this experience, start by going through the [Introduction to Widgets](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/widgets-intro) Codelab. This Codelab uses DartPad, so use it.  Take your time and try to understand everything that happens. 



Once you've finished with the Codelab, please follow these steps to transfer the final code from DartPad into a working Flutter app.

1. Create a private GitHub repository called "flutter_shopping_list".  (Note the use of underscores, not hyphens. This follows Flutter best practices for app naming.) Add a README file to make it easier to clone to your desktop.
2. Make me a collaborator so I can view your work.
3. Clone it to your laptop.
4. In the parent directory of that directory, run `flutter create --no-overwrite flutter_shopping_list` in a terminal or shell window.  This will produce the Flutter app skeleton at the top level of your GitHub repo.
5. Change directory into flutter_shopping_list, and run `flutter run` to verify that your laptop is configured correctly for Flutter and can run the skeleton app. Once you've verified that it runs correctly, you can type "q" to quit execution.
5. Now open your repo in IntelliJ.
6. Open the iOS or Android Simulator, then run the template code and see it in the simulator. This verifies you can also run the system from within your editor.

Now that you've established a working codebase and development environment, you can replace the main.dart file contents with the final shopping list code.

* Delete test directory to get rid of red arrow under project.

</div>



When you've finished, commit your code to GitHub.
