# Experience building FTW Wireframes

## Task

For this task, you will design screens that illustrate the design, functionality, and innovative features of your FTW app. 

You should make a copy of the [FTW Wireframe Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UFXI_fGII33qpM8p8cj4MXkgDq--Xm6dUFmsayjYDVo/edit?usp=sharing). 

Then modify the contents so that you have designed as many screens as possible. Ideally, you will create wireframes to illustrate the complete functionality of your app. At a minimum, you should create six pages. 

As the template shows, I don't care about the "realism" of the wireframe at this point.  You can make a crude version with Google Slide objects, or you can use pencil and paper and take a photo, or you can cut and paste an image from the web. 

What is most important for these wireframes is that gives you an opportunity to think hard about what is "innovative" about your app, and focus on that aspect of the design. 

At this stage, there is no point in focusing on the login screen, or logout screen, and so forth. Those screens are boilerplate and are not innovative. Do not waste your time (you can just edit the login screen from the template and use that). 

You can work alone, or in groups. If you work in a group, then just create a single slide deck collaboratively and everyone should submit the same URL.

Be sure to include the authors on the first page of the slide deck.

The more time you invest in this design process, the less time you will spend later during implementation, and the higher the odds of a successful project.
