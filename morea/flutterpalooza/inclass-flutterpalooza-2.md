# In class: FTW Wireframes

## Setup: Decide on your project to wireframe.

Divide up into groups of 3-4. 

Introduce yourself to your group mates.

Decide on the project idea that you want to wireframe for this experience.

## Wireframe

You will create a Google Slide with at least six screens that illustrate critical functionality of your app. 

To start, one person in your group will make a copy of the [Wireframe Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UFXI_fGII33qpM8p8cj4MXkgDq--Xm6dUFmsayjYDVo/edit?usp=sharing) Google Slide doc. 

Then, that person will make that document editable by anyone with the link to it. 

Then, work together to create wireframes for at least six pages.  You can use google slide objects, or you can use pencil and paper and upload a picture. Whatever you prefer. The template shows both options.

Don't bother to create wireframes for the signin page (you can use the existing one), or for registration and forgot password. Those are all "generic" pages. Focus on the pages that illustrate the unique value proposition of the app.

You will present your wireframes for discussion near the end of the class period.

## Submission instructions

By the end of the class period, each person must upload the link to the google doc containing their group's wireframe to Laulima.
