# Join the Flutter Communities

You will get up to speed faster with Flutter if you engage with the online communities.  These communities are useful for helping you become aware of the latest updates and tutorials.

You can visit the [Flutter Community](https://flutter.dev/community) page for full details. You can sign up for the Flutter newsletter on that page by providing your email address.

I recommend you join the [Flutter Slack Workspace](https://fluttercommunity.dev/joinslack) and the [Flutter Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/N7Yshp4). Although I normally prefer Discord to Slack, I have found the Slack community to be better organized and more useful than the Discord server. YMMV.
