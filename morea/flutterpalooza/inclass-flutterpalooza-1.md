# In class: Flutterpalooza (1)

Divide up into groups of 3-4. 

Introduce yourself to your group mates.

One person should be the "scribe". This person should create a google doc, provide write access to everyone on the internet, andshare the link with the other group members.

Each person in the group should, in turn, "pitch their project". For the FTW project you are currently leaning toward (which may be in the list of projects, or might be your personal research project), you should discuss:

1. Why you think your chosen project is cool;
2. Why others should help you with it (this could involve factors other than the project itself. For example, maybe you live on a boat and you can have team meetings on a boat!)
3. How you will get at least a dozen test users for the app. (These shouldn't be random people--they should be people who would have a natural interest in your app.)

If more than one person in the group has chosen the same project, that's fine: just augment what previous people have said with additional information.

The scribe should take careful notes.

At the conclusion of this exercise, each group will present their findings to the class.
