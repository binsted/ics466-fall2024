## Task

For this experience, start with the following steps to initialize your development environment:

1. Create a private GitHub repository called "flutter_startup_namer".  (Note the use of underscores, not hyphens. This follows Flutter best practices for app naming.) Add a README file to make it easier to clone to your desktop.
2. Make me a collaborator so I can view your work.
3. Clone it to your laptop.
4. In the parent directory of that directory, run `flutter create --no-overwrite flutter_startup_namer` in a terminal or shell window.  This will produce the Flutter app skeleton at the top level of your GitHub repo.
5. Change directory into flutter_startup_namer, and run `flutter run` to verify that your laptop is configured correctly for Flutter and can run the skeleton app. Once you've verified that it runs correctly, you can type "q" to quit execution.
5. Now open your repo in IntelliJ.
6. Open the iOS or Android Simulator, then run the template code and see it in the simulator. This verifies you can also run the system from within your editor.

Now that you've established a working codebase and development environment, proceed with [Your first Flutter app](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first#0).

<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-exclamation fa-xl"></i> **Notes**
<hr/>

* You can skip some of the intro steps (on installing Flutter). Start with the step in which you replace the contents of pubspec.yml in the "Create Project" step.

* After replacing the contents of pubspec.yml, analysis_options.yml, and main.dart, you might want to run 'flutter pub get' to download the new dependencies. This should also remove any errors flagged in main.dart.

* In IntelliJ, to "wrap" a widget with a Padding, Container, or other widget, put your cursor on the line to be wrapped, and press "option-return" to call up the menu of possible wrapper widgets.

* At some point, you might want to delete the test directory to get rid of red arrow under project.

* When you've finished the code lab, be sure to commit your code to GitHub.
