# Material Advanced Components

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert" markdown="1">
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-exclamation fa-xl"></i> **This Codelab is optional**
<hr/>

This codelab added a lot of complexity to the app. While interesting, I don't think the resulting code is particularly useful for your personal code library.

Therefore, I am making this codelab optional and directing you to implement it in a branch so that you still have easy access to the result of the previous Codelab in your main branch. 
</div>

## Task

For this task, please continue with the fourth part of the MDC Codelab, [MDC-104 Flutter: Material Advanced Components](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-104-flutter#0).

You will learn how to create a backdrop and add shape and motion.

If you choose to do this Codelab, I recommend that you create a branch called MDC-104 to hold your changes so that the main branch retains the final code from the third CodeLab.


## Submission Instructions

No submission required.
