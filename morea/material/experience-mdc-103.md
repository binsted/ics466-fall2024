# Material Theming with Color, Shape, Elevation, and Type

## Task

For this task, please continue with the third part of the MDC Codelab, [MDC-103 Flutter: Material Theming with Color, Shape, Elevation, and Type](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-103-flutter#0).

You will learn how to adjust theme, typography, elevation, and shape.

I found this codelab to get a little tedious at times, and I'm not sure some of the changes actually improved the UI design, but it was interesting and useful to see how various Material design components are implemented in Flutter.

## Submission Instructions
