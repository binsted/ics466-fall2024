# In class: Material Design (1)

## Setup: Material Design vs. Human Interface Guidelines

Divide up into groups of 3-4. 

Introduce yourself to your group mates.

One person should create a google doc and provide write access to everyone on the internet, then share the link with the other group members.

The two primary UI guidelines for mobile app design are [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/) for Android and [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines) for iOS. 

First, as a group, do research to discover what the primary differences are between Material Design and HIG. You can use Google, or if you have a taste for adventure, ChatGPT.

However you do this research, please do it collectively as a group. (Share your screen, read out the results, etc).  Document your learnings in your google doc.

Flutter has very good support for implementing native mobile user interfaces using Material Design conventions on both Android and iOS. (This is we have been doing so far in this course.) 

Flutter has some support for building UIs that conform to HIG when on iOS, and conform to Material Design when on Android. 

After spending a few minutes learning about the primary differences between the two UI design approaches, discuss as a group whether you feel:

1. The differences aren't important as long as the UI is simple and intuitive. There is no need to avoid Material Design when deploying to iOS.

2. There are certain circumstances where it is important to adhere to the platform's design conventions. 

3. The differences are significant. One should always conform to the platform's design conventions. 

Once you've decided what your group feels, document your conclusion. Provide supporting evidence for your claim.

We will discuss each group's view in class.
