# 5. Install Flutter

## Task

1. Install Flutter following the directions in the associated Reading. (To install Android SDKManager cmdline-tools;latest, I brought up Android Studio -> Preferences -> Search for "sdk", then clicked the box to install the cmdline-tools.)

2. Create a public GitHub repo called flutter-helloworld and clone it to your laptop.

3. Create the default Flutter project in your repo by running `flutter create helloworld` inside your local repo directory.

4. Verify that the project runs correctly by invoking `flutter run`.

5. Open it in IntelliJ (or your selected editor), and run it inside your editor, displaying the results in either an iOS or Android simulator.

6. Commit your project to GitHub.
