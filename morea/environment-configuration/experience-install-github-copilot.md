# 6. Install GitHub Copilot

## Task

While not required for this class, we recommend that you install GitHub Copilot. You can follow the instructions in the associated Reading.

We find that GitHub Copilot suggests reasonable code completions up to 50% of the time. That's good enough to be useful, even though it does mean you have to still read and understand the suggested code in order to decide if it is implementing the desired behavior.
