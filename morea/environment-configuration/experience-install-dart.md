# 3. Install Dart

## Task

1. Install the Dart SDK, following the instructions in the Reading.
2. Install the plugin for Dart. If you are using IntelliJ, instructions are here: <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/dart.html#download_dart_tools>
3. Create a new public GitHub repo called "dart-helloworld" and clone it to your laptop. 
4. Create a new (command line) dart program called "helloworld" in that repo by running the command `dart create helloworld` in that directory.
5. Open the bin/helloworld.dart file in your editor, make sure the dart SDK can be found.
6. Verify that you can run `dart analyze` on your helloworld program and that no errors are found.
7. Run the program both from the command line and from within IntelliJ (or whatever editor you are using).
8. Review the three files: bin/helloworld.dart, lib/helloworld.dart, and test/helloworld_test.dart
9. Verify that you can run `dart test` on your code and that the tests pass. 
9. Commit your code to GitHub.
