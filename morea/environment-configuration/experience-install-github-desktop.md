# 2. Install GitHub Desktop

## Task

Install GitHub Desktop following the instructions in the associated Reading.

We recommend that you use GitHub desktop for this class:

* It provides a high quality UI that helps you use git correctly. Unless you are an expert user of git, you will likely avoid significant problems by using GitHub desktop.

That said, if you want to use some other git client for this class, then you are free to do so.

## Submission instructions

You will be required to commit code to GitHub in class.
