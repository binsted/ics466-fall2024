# 1. Install IntelliJ IDEA

## Task

Please follow the instructions in the Reading to install IntelliJ IDEA.

We recommend you use IntelliJ IDEA for this course:

* IntelliJ IDEA has a plugin for Dart and Flutter that provides very useful support for development.
* Android Studio is based on IntelliJ, so this interface will be familiar. 
* It will be easier for you to collaborate with others if you are all using the same editor (i.e. it will be easier for you to look over their shoulder when you are helping them debug a problem and understand the editor UI.)

That said, you can use (say) VS Code if you have a strong preference.

## Submission instructions

You will be required to use your IDE in class.
