# Review the Dart Language Guide

Prior to starting this task, you should have installed Dart and DartPad successfully (see the [Environment Configuration](../../modules/environment-configuration) module).

## Task

Read through the following sections of the [Dart Language Guide](https://dart.dev/language):
* Introduction
* Syntax Basics
* Types
* Functions
* Control Flow
* Classes and Objects
* Null Safety

You can skip the other sections for now: Patterns, Error Handling, Class Modifiers, and Concurrency

Much of the Dart language looks like Javascript.  Here are some of the features I found interesting and novel while reading through the tour:

* non-null, 
* set literals, 
* maps, 
* initializer lists for class constructors, 
* cascade operator, 
* skip() and take() operations on lists

## Submission Instructions

By the time and date listed on the Schedule page, please submit to Laulima a short description (maximum three paragraphs) with your initial impressions of Dart and how it compares to "your favorite" programming language (i.e. Java, Javascript, Python, etc). 

Please don't use ChatGPT to write your essay for you. Instead, just provide your honest reflection.
