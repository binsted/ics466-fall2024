# In class: Usability Evaluation Design

Please work in your group today on the design of your project's usability evaluation.

If you haven't already, create a file called evaluation.md at the top level of your project site with the following contents in markdown format:

Title: The title should be (Project) Usability Evaluation Design. Replace (Project) by your project name.

User Goals:  A subsection called "User Goals" that you are planning to test. 

Scenarios: A subsection called "Scenarios". Each goal should be evaluated via one or more scenarios. Each scenario description should include both a description of the prompt you will give the user, as well as what would constitute a successful behavior on the part of the user.

User Types: A subsection called "User Types".  For example, if your app is about pet health, then important user types might include “pet owner” and “veterinarian”.

Recruitment: A subsection called "Recruitment". This section describes how you plan to obtain a half dozen people for each of your user types. 

During the last 15 minutes of class we will review your work. Please post the URL to your markdown file to the #usability-design-review channel.
