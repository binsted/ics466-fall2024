# Consent form

I agree to participate in a class exercise conducted by students in the ICS Mobile Application Development class taught by Professor Kim Binsted. 

* The purpose of this exercise is for students to gain an understanding of usability testing by carrying out a usability test with you as a subject.

* This exercise will take N minutes, and will involve you interacting with a mobile application developed by the students. During this time, the students may ask you questions and/or take notes on your behavior with the app and your thoughts as you use it.

* There is no risk to you from your participation. No personally identifying information will be recorded about you. 

* The outcome of this exercise will be a report on the usability of the app that will be made available on the app's project site. It will include data from you and several other participants. If you like, the students can send you a link to this report when it is available.

If, at any point in the session, you wish your data to be excluded, please inform the students. If, after the session has concluded, you wish your data to be excluded, please contact Professor Kim Binsted, binsted@hawaii.edu, 808-956-6107.

Please sign below to indicate that you have read and understand this consent form and that any questions you have (at this point) have been answered to your satisfaction.
